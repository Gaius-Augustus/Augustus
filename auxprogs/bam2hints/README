Prior to compiling "bam2hints" you need to have BAMTools on your system.

--- If you have Ubuntu or Debian ---

Install bamtools and libbamtools-dev:
   
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install bamtools libbamtools-dev

For older versions of Ubuntu than xenial like vivid, make sure the repository "universe" is in your '/etc/apt/sources.list'. 
It should contain a line like:

     deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu vivid main universe

See docs/INSTALL.md (Bamtools section) for further details, especially for manual installation from sources or installation without root rights.

Afterwards, go to the auxprogs/bam2hints directory and run

   make

This produces a bam2hints binary that is located in auxprogs/bam2hints.
