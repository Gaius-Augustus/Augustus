		1. INTRODUCTION
		----------------

filterBAM is a C++ routine for filtering BAM alignment files; it is based on filterPSL, a Perl script written
by Prof. Dr. Mario Stanke for the cleaning of PSL alignment files. For more information regarding the
filter, please check the accompanying PDF file, located under the 'doc' directory of this installation.

		2. DEPENDENCIES
		----------------

1. Bamtools' API is required for compilation.

*** On Ubunutu or Debian ***
------------------

Install bamtools and libbamtools-dev:

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install bamtools libbamtools-dev

For older versions of Ubuntu than xenial like vivid, make sure the repository "universe" is in your '/etc/apt/sources.list'.
It should contain a line like:

     deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu vivid main universe

See docs/INSTALL.md (Bamtools section) for further details, especially for manual installation from sources
or installation without root rights.

Once with Bamtools, filterBam can be compiled (see Section 3).

After compilation of Bamtools, a binary 'bamtools' is created. This so-called utility-kit allows the:
sorting, sampling, filtering, among other things, of of BAM files. It is recommended to practice a bit with
such features given that filterBam only accepts as input BAM files that have been previously sorted by
'query name'.

********************************

2. Although not required by filterBam, it may also be convenient to have a copy of the software Samtools.
See docs/INSTALL.md (SAMtools section) for further details.

NOTE: Some examples on how to use Samtools and Bamtools utility kits are provided in the user manual of
filterBam.

		3. INSTALLING
		----------------

1. Download and extract the latest version of filterBam from the AUGUSTUS repository.

2. Compile filterBam by typing

> make

3. A binary file 'filterBam' should be stored in the folder 'bin'

> ls bin


		4. RUNNING
		----------------

Get the 'help' menu by typing

>./filterBam --help

Some toy data sets are stored in the folder 'data' in case you want to see how the filter works.
