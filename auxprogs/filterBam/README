		1. INTRODUCTION
		----------------

filterBAM is a C++ routine for filtering BAM alignment files; it is based on filterPSL, a Perl script written 
by Prof. Dr. Mario Stanke for the cleaning of PSL alignment files. For more information regarding the 
filter, please check the accompanying PDF file, located under the 'doc' directory of this installation.

		2. DEPENDENCIES
		----------------

1. Bamtools' API is required for compilation, so go to the web-page: https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools/wiki , and more specifically to the section 'Building and installing' for instructions on how to get and compile 
the latest version of Bamtools. The softwares 'git' and 'cmake' will probably be required as well. Once with Bamtools, filterBam can be compiled (see Section 3).

After compilation of Bamtools, a binary 'bamtools' is created. This so-called utility-kit allows the: 
sorting, sampling, filtering, among other things, of of BAM files. It is recommended to practice a bit with 
such features given that filterBam only accepts as input BAM files that have been previously sorted by 
'query name'. 

2. Although not required by filterBam, it may also be convenient to have a copy of the software Samtools. 
This software is available via subversion (svn) on the web page: http://samtools.sourceforge.net/ . Follow 
the installation instructions contained in the distribution package of Samtools.

NOTE: Some examples on how to use Samtools and Bamtools utility kits are provided in the user manual of 
filterBam.

 		3. INSTALLING
		----------------

1. Download and extract the latest version of filterBam from the AUGUSTUS repository. 

2. Create and export an enviroment variable called 'BAMTOOLS' that points to the top-level directory where 
Bamtools resides, e.g.

> export BAMTOOLS=/home/tonatiuh/Documents/git/bamtools

2. Compile filterBam by typing 

> make

3. A binary file 'filterBam' should be stored in the folder 'bin'

> ls bin


		4. RUNNING
		----------------

Get the 'help' menu by typing 

>./filterBam --help 

Some toy data sets are stored in the folder 'data' in case you want to see how the filter works.
