<h1>MySQL++ Reference Manual</h1>
<p>
<h3 align="center">3.1.0 </h3><h2><a class="anchor" name="getting_started">
Getting Started</a></h2>
The best place to get started is the <a href="../userman/index.html">user manual</a>. It provides a guide to the example programs and more.<h2><a class="anchor" name="classes">
Major Classes</a></h2>
In MySQL++, the main user-facing classes are <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1Connection.html">mysqlpp::Connection</a>, <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1Query.html">mysqlpp::Query</a>, <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1Row.html">mysqlpp::Row</a>, <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1StoreQueryResult.html">mysqlpp::StoreQueryResult</a>, and <a class="el" href="classmysqlpp_1_1UseQueryResult.html">mysqlpp::UseQueryResult</a>.<p>
In addition, MySQL++ has a mechanism called Specialized SQL Structures (SSQLS), which allow you to create C++ structures that parallel the definition of the tables in your database schema. These let you manipulate the data in your database using native C++ data structures. Programs using this feature often include very little SQL code, because MySQL++ can generate most of what you need automatically when using SSQLSes. There is a whole chapter in the user manual on how to use this feature of the library, plus a section in the user manual's tutorial chapter to introduce it. It's possible to use MySQL++ effectively without using SSQLS, but it sure makes some things a lot easier.<h2><a class="anchor" name="files">
Major Files</a></h2>
The only two header files your program ever needs to include are mysql++.h, and optionally custom.h. (The latter implements the SSQLS mechanism.) All of the other files are used within the library only.<h2><a class="anchor" name="user_questions">
If You Have Questions...</a></h2>
If you want to email someone to ask questions about this library, we greatly prefer that you send mail to the MySQL++ mailing list, which you can subscribe to here: <a href="http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus">http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus</a><p>
That mailing list is archived, so if you have questions, do a search to see if the question has been asked before.<p>
You may find people's individual email addresses in various files within the MySQL++ distribution. Please do not send mail to them unless you are sending something that is inherently personal. Questions that are about MySQL++ usage may well be ignored if you send them to our personal email accounts. Those of us still active in MySQL++ development monitor the mailing list, so you aren't getting any extra "coverage" by sending messages to those addresses in addition to the mailing list.<h2><a class="anchor" name="licensing">
