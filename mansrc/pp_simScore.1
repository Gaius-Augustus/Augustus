.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Algorithm for calculating the similarity score and the optimal alignments of a block\-profile and a protein sequence.
The algorithm can optional take intron positions into account. Print to standard output.

.RS 4
Protein sequence file in FASTA format.
.br
It may contain an optional [Intron] section. This section denotes the
intron positions in the protein sequence, which are specified as list of
(j, f), where j is the index of the amino acid after witch the intron
immediately occurs. The indices range from 0 to m \- 1 if the protein
sequence has a length of m.

.RS 4
The block profile file has to have following structure:
.RE
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    [dist]
    min    max
    [block]
    B
    [intron profile]
    w
    inter\-block_profile_list
    intra\-block_profile_list
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
This structure can be repeated in this file. The file has to end either
in a [dist] section or a [dist] and than [intron profile] section.
The [intron profile] sections are optional.

    [dist] explanation:
    min, max denote the distance interval of an inter\-block section

    [block] explanation:
    B denotes a (20 x t) matrix for a block of t of the block\-profile

    [intron profile] explanation:
    an intron profile describes the positions and frequencies of introns in and
    before the associated block
    w: number of protein family members used to build the intron profile
    inter\-block_profile_list: list of (h, v),
    where   h denotes the number of introns which occurred within a family member,
            v the number of family members which have this number of introns
    intra\-block_profile_list: list (s, f, v),
    where   s denotes the index of the position in the block after which an intron occurs,
            f denotes the number of nucleotides which are left before the intron (0,1,2)
            v the number of family members which have an intron at that position
