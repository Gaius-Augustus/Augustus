.SH "NAME"
filterbam \- filter BAM file for use with AUGUSTUS tools
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBfilterBam\fP \-\-in in.bam \-\-out out.bam [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The input file must be sorted lexicographically by \(aqqueryname\(aq, with e.g.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBsort \-k 1,1\fP [be aware: \(aqexport LC_ALL=C\(aq might be used  because sort ignores characters like \(aq:\(aq]
Also, please bear in mind that this will require converting your BAM file into SAM.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBsamtools\fP and \fBbamtools\fP provide facilities to do the sorting,
but they are not guaranteed to work because of the problem mentioned above.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
In the case of \fBsamtools\fP, the command is: \(aqsamtools sort [\-n] file.bam\(aq.
The option [\-n] should sort by query name, just as \(aqsort \-k 10,10\(aq would do in a PSL file.
Without options, the sorting will be done by reference name and target coordinate, just as a  \(aqsort \-n \-k 16,16 | sort \-k 14,14\(aq would do with PSL.
For more information check the man page included in samtools distribution.

.\}
.el \{\

bamtools can also sort bam files: \fBbamtools sort \-queryname \-in file.bam\fP,
but only provides the option to do it by queryname.
.RE
.sp
If the option \(aqpaired\(aq is used, then alignment names must include suffixes /1,/2 or /f,/r.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-paired\fP
.RS 4
require that paired reads are on opposite strands of same target
(default 0). NOTE: see prerequisite section above.

.RS 4
take only best match, iff, second best is much worse  (default 0)
.RE

filtered read pairs is reported that contain the position in
or between the reads
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-pairwiseAlignments\fP
.RS 4
