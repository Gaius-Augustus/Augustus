# load2sqlitedb(1)

## NAME

load2sqlitedb - load genome sequences and extrinsic evidence hints into a SQLite database

## SYNOPSIS

*load2sqlitedb* [OPTIONS] --species=_SPECIES_ --dbaccess=_database.db_ _inputfilename_

## DESCRIPTION

*load2sqlitedb* is a tool to load genome sequences and extrinsic evidence hints into a SQLite database. +
When storing genomes/hints of multiple organisms call this program repeatedly for each one.

## OPTIONS

_inputfilename_ refers to a genome file in FASTA format or a hints file in GFF format.

### Mandatory options
    
*-s*, *--species*=_SPECIES_::
  SPECIES is a name for your species and the same identifier as is used in the treefile and alnfile parameters to augustus.

*-d*, *--dbaccess*=_database.db_::
  The file name of the SQLite database that will be opened or created if it does not already exist.

### Additional options

*-c*, *--chunksize*=_size_::
  This option is only relevant when loading a sequence file. +
  The sequences in the input genome are split into chunks of this size so
  that subsequent retrievals of small sequence ranges do not require to read
  the complete - potentially much longer - chromosome. (<= 1000000). Default Value: 50000

*-i*, *--noIdx*::
  Use this flag to suppress the building of indices on the database tables. +
  If you are going to load several genomes and/or hint files in a row, this option
  is recommended to speed up the loading. But make sure to build indices with
  --makeIdx after all genomes/hints are loaded. Otherwise, data retrieval operations
  can be very slow.

*-m*, *--makeIdx*::
  Use this flag to build the indices on the database tables after loading several genomes and/or hint files with --noIdx. +
  Only call this once for all species, e.g. load2sqlitedb --makeIdx --dbaccess=database.db

*-r*, *--clean*::
  Makes a clean load deleting existing hints/genome for the species from the database.+
  When called with a gff file, only the hints for the species are delete, but not the genome. +
  When called with a fasta file, both hints and genome for the species are deleted.

*-h*, *--help*::
   Produce help message.
